<h3>Dashboard Project - Customer Analysis</h3>

<p><p>This Power BI dashboard was designed to analyze customer profiles and behavior for a fictional global retail company. As the year-end approached, the company sought a data-driven assessment of its customer base to understand its business performance better and develop targeted strategies for future growth. This report presents the following procedures:</p>

<br>

- Data extraction and cleaning from the company's database, selecting relevant customer information and their contribution to sales performance;  
- Customer segmentation based on salary range, age group, gender, education level, and location;  
- Correlation of these segments with key metrics such as customer count, average purchase ticket, total revenue, average salary, and average age.  
  
<p>The report concluded that the company‚Äôs customer base is primarily well-educated and located in North America. However, customers with high education levels and lower income brackets tend to spend a disproportionately higher average purchase ticket than other segments. It is recommended that the company implements strategies to retain this customer group, as their spending patterns indicate a potential risk of customer attrition due to financial constraints.</p>

<h3>Sales Performance and Delivery Quality Analysis</h3>

<p>Project developed during Bruce Fonseca's Power BI & Data Analytics course, aimed at analyzing the sales performance and delivery service quality of a fictional company. In this project, we first summarized sales data from the past four years to provide management with an overview of the company‚Äôs performance. Next, we conducted an in-depth analysis of the characteristics and details of the product delivery process over these years to identify potential areas impacting service quality and customer relationships.</p>

<p>The key steps in developing this report were:</p>


- **Data loading and cleaning:** Standardization of data types, removal of null values, and manipulation of existing tables.  
- **Table transformations:** Merging columns and creating custom columns to facilitate analysis. For example, we created calculated columns to display the delivery status of each sale (whether it was delayed or not) and to indicate the number of days delivery was overdue when applicable.  
- **Development of key measures in DAX:** Using iteration functions, the <code>CALCULATE()</code> function, time intelligence functions, variables, and ranking techniques.  
- **Data segmentation into key categories:** Initially distributing sales by category and time. We incorporated tooltip and floating menu features to provide more detailed insights into the data.  
- **Delivery segmentation:** Creating specific measures for delivery analysis. At this stage, we used the "Key Influencers" visual to understand how different categories impact late deliveries.  
- **Detailed analysis of late deliveries:** We developed a dedicated page to visualize the distribution of late deliveries across categories. This page includes a table showcasing the performance of each product category.
  
<h3>Key Findings and Recommendations</h3>

<p>The report concluded that, despite a decline in revenue in 2020, the company has shown strong recovery indicators. Sales have grown by 13% and 5% over the past two years, with notable growth in the cities of Sorocaba and Blumenau. Annual performance has also stabilized compared to the previous year. However, the North and Northeast regions have experienced a concerning drop in sales, particularly in the second half of the year, with the cities of Itapu√£ and Vit√≥ria da Conquista standing out in this decline. Additionally, 60% of deliveries are delayed, with an average delay of six days.</p>

<p>The following actions are recommended for the company:</p>

- **Reevaluate marketing and customer retention strategies in the North and Northeast regions.** While the per-unit product sales remain significant, overall profitability has declined sharply. This signals a risk of losing customers and increasing delivery costs.  
- **Improve delivery control mechanisms.** The high rate of late deliveries across all regions of Brazil indicates a structural issue that needs to be addressed.  
- **Optimize pricing policies based on regional delivery performance.** In the previous year, the company made more deliveries but achieved lower profitability. This suggests that while sales volume decreased, revenue per sale increased. It would be beneficial to identify the key factors behind this trend to eliminate low-profitability delivery expenses and strengthen the sales that have been growing.
